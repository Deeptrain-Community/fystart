# Privacy Policy

Welcome to our fystart. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information Collection

Our browser start page utilizes a third-party provided by OpenAI, for the search feature. When you use the search functionality, your search queries and related information will be sent to the OpenAI service to provide search results and relevant suggestions. We do not associate this information with any personally identifiable information.

However, we provide customizable options, and you can choose to disable this feature by adjusting the settings in your browser.

Please note that OpenAI is an independent third-party service, and its use and protection of personal information are governed by its own privacy policy. We recommend that you read and understand their privacy policy before using the OpenAI service.

## Log Data

We may collect log data about your usage of the browser start page. This log data may include your IP address, access time, browser type and version, operating system information, and more. We use this log data for the improvement, troubleshooting, and security monitoring of the browser start page. It is not associated with any personally identifiable information.

## Third-Party Services

Our browser start page may contain links or content from third-party websites or services. Please note that these third-party sites or services have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their actions and practices. Before accessing these third-party links or using their services, please read and understand their privacy policies.

## Security

We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information you provide to us. We use local storage technology to enhance user experience and functionality instead of cookies. Local storage is a method of storing data in your browser that offers higher security compared to cookies.
